TODO:

Need to add preview capabilities. We should scan the preview first, and if there is no match, call cont() and get the
rest of the message.

Need to have a threshold for scanning size. Basically if the content is less than that threshold, then we can load it
all into memory, scan, and handle it. If it exceeds the threshold, then we need to load it chunk by chunk and scan
it that way, writing to the client as we go. If a match is found, we need to find a way of blocking. Perhaps a redirect
is in order.

For large downloads, the content replacement module will just have to do replacements chunk by chunk. This is very
limiting because of the possibility of variable length regexes, but we will have to assume for now that no such case
will ever be needed.
